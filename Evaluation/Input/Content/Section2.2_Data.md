### In vitro / physico-chemical Data <a id="invitro-and-physico-chemical-data"></a>

A literature search was performed to collect available information on physicochemical properties of CDA1. The obtained information from literature is summarized in the table below. 

| **Parameter** | **Unit** | **Value** | Source                       | **Description**                                              |
| :------------ | -------- | --------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |

| r             | nm       | 5.34      | [Taylor 1984](#5-references) | Hydrodynamic solute radius                                   |
| Kd (FcRn)     | µM       | 0.63      | [Zhou 2003](#5-references)   | Dissociation constant for binding of a human IgG1 antibody to human FcRn at pH 6 |

### PK Data <a id="PK-data"></a>

Published clinical PK data on CDA1 in healthy adults were used.

| Publication                 | Description                                                  |
| :-------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| [Taylor2008](#5-references) | The plasma concentration–time profiles after single i.v. infusion of 5, 10 and 20 mg/kg CDA1 in healthy adults were used. The data for the dosages 0.3 and 1 mg/kg were not used since the PK data could not be read with sufficient accuracy from the published figure. |
