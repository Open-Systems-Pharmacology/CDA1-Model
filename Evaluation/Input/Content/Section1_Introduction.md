CDA1 is a human monoclonal antibody (IgG1) against the toxin A of *Clostridium difficile*.

CDA1 shows a pharmacokinetic behavior which is typical for an antibody without endogenous target. The plasma concentrationâ€“time profiles after i.v. infusion of 5, 10 and 20 mg/kg CDA1 in healthy adults ([Taylor 2008](#5-references)) were used together with pharmacokinetic (PK) data from 5 other compounds to identify unknown parameters during the development of the generic large molecule physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model in PK-Sim ([Niederalt 2018](#5-references)). 

The herein presented evaluation report evaluates the performance of the PBPK model for CDA1 in healthy adults for the PK data used for the development of the generic large molecule model in PK-Sim.

The presented CDA1 PBPK model as well as the respective evaluation plan and evaluation report are provided open-source (https://github.com/Open-Systems-Pharmacology/CDA1-Model).
