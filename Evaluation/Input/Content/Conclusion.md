The herein presented PBPK model overall adequately describes the pharmacokinetics of CDA1 in healthy humans. The initial plasma concentrations are slightly underestimated especially for the higher dose. 

 The PK data had been used during the development of the generic large molecule PBPK model in PK-Sim ([Niederalt 2018](#5-references)) together with PK data from 5 other compounds (7E3, BAY 79-4620, dAb2, MEDI-524 & MEDI-524-YTE).
