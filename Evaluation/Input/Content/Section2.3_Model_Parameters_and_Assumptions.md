### 2.3.1	Absorption

There is no absorption process since CDA1 was administered intravenously.

### 2.3.2	Distribution

The standard lymph and fluid recirculation flow rates and the standard vascular properties of the different tissues (hydraulic conductivity, pore radii, fraction of flow via large pores) from PK-Sim were used. CDA1, among other compounds, has been used to identify these lymph and fluid recirculation flow rates used in PK-Sim ([Niederalt 2018](#5-references)).

### 2.3.3	Metabolism and Elimination

The FcRn mediated clearance present in the standard PK-Sim model was  used as only clearance process. The standard physiological parameters related to FcRn mediated clearance were used (rate constants for endosomal uptake and recycling, association rate constant for FcRn binding and concentration of FcRn in the endosomal space). CDA1, among other compounds, has been used to identify these parameters using literature values for the drug affinities to FcRn in the endosomal space ([Niederalt 2018](#5-references)).

### 2.3.4	Automated Parameter Identification

No drug specific parameters were fitted. CDA1, among other compounds, has been used to develop the model for proteins and large molecules in PK-Sim ([Niederalt 2018](#5-references)).
