The PBPK model for CDA1 was evaluated with clinical PK data in healthy adults. 

These PK data have been used together with PK data from 5 other compounds to simultaneously identify parameters during the development of the generic model for proteins and large molecules in PK-Sim ([Niederalt 2018](#5-references)).



The next sections show:

1. the final model parameters for the building blocks: [Section 3.1](#31-final-input-parameters).
2. the overall goodness of fit: [Section 3.2](#32-diagnostics-plots).
3. simulated vs. observed concentration-time profiles for the clinical studies used for model building and for model verification: [Section 3.3](#33-concentration-time-profiles).
